Hi <%= @user.user_profile.try(:first_name) %>!

I'm Greg, the creator of babygrams. Thank you for trying out my app! I wanted to check in and see how your order went. Did the people you sent cards to enjoy them? Did you run into any trouble using the app? Do you think you'll send more?

Any feedback you have would be awesome! Also, if you enjoyed babygrams, if you could leave a review on the App Store, that would help me out a lot.

For your trouble, here's a link that will give you 10 free credits, good for one free card:

Enjoy! Feel free to reply directly to this e-mail, I'll be here :)

Thanks again!
