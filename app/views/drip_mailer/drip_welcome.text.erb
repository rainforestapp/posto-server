Hi <%= @user.user_profile.try(:first_name) %>!

I'm Greg, the creator of babygrams. I wanted to let you know I really appreciate you trying out babygrams! I wanted to check in and see how your order went. Did the people you sent cards to enjoy them? Did you run into any trouble using the app? Do you think you'll send more?

Any feedback you have would be awesome! Feel free to reply directly to this e-mail, I'll be sure to answer :)

Thanks again!
